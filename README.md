# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

Features:
Category-based News: The app organizes news articles into various categories such as entertainment, business, sports, technology, health, science, and more. Users can select a category to view articles related to that specific topic.

Search News: A search bar allows users to find specific news articles by entering keywords. The app then displays articles relevant to the entered search terms.

Article Details: Each article includes a title, description, publication date, source channel, and a link to the original source. This ensures users have all the information they need before deciding to read the full article.

Responsive Design: The app is designed to adapt to different screen sizes, providing a smooth experience whether accessed from a desktop, tablet, or smartphone.

Technologies Used:
React: The app is built with React, a leading JavaScript library for constructing user interfaces, which offers a solid foundation for creating dynamic and interactive components.

Redux: State management is handled by Redux, ensuring a well-organized and predictable flow of data throughout the application.

Styled-Components: For styling, the app uses Styled-Components, allowing developers to write CSS directly within JavaScript for more manageable component-specific styles.

React-Bootstrap: React-Bootstrap is employed to create responsive and customizable UI components, offering a range of pre-built elements that integrate seamlessly into the app.

Axios: Axios, a JavaScript library for making HTTP requests, is used to fetch data from the GNews public API.
